# pyTwittertoRSS
Simple app to create a RSS feed from your Twitter timeline.

This is a simple app I created years ago to convert my Twitter feed to a RSS feed.

Fill out GlobalSettings.py with your Twitter app credentials and specify the file locations.

When run, it will create a sqlite database and run a command to scp the feed xml to a location of your choice.

Feel free to do whatever you'd like with it.
